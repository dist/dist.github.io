DIST
=====

# Welcome
A completely open and infinitely extensible distributed computing platform


### What is this?

Dist is about fostering technologies that bring the power of the Internet and computer technologies back to the individual. We are helping to develop and improve true peer-to-peer solutions to do this.

### About DIST

Dist consists of three primary projects: an organization, a network, and a software platform

- Organization
  - Loosely knit group of contributors and leaders helping to establish dist using their own time
- Network
  - Resembles a gnunet project using the latest peer to peer technologies. This, like all things dist, will be an always ongoing and refactored effort
- Software Platform
  - Desktop, mobile, virtual, IoT (Internet of Things), and portable infinitely extensible IDE built on an architecture of objects and streams
